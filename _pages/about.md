Hi, I'm Panagiotis. I am a graduate with a diploma from [School of Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering](http://www.naval.ntua.gr/) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) (NTUA). My thesis title was: "Operational Assessment of Marine Diesel Generators using Data".

My passion for mathematics, technology, and financial markets is expressed by my current objective to delve into finance and try to solve complex engineering challenges.

I am a former chartering assistant intern in [Latsco Marine Management Inc.](https://www.latsco.com/en), where I initially worked in the financial markets.
