Hi, I'm Panagiotis. I am a graduate with a diploma (B.Sc. & M.Sc.) from [School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering](http://www.naval.ntua.gr/) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) (NTUA). My thesis title was: "Operational Assessment of Marine Diesel Generators using Data".

I am a former chartering intern in [Latsco Marine Management Inc.](https://www.latsco.com/en), where I worked in the financial markets and global trade.

I am currently working as a technical coordinator at Technomar Shipping Inc., which is the manager of [Global Ship Lease Inc.](https://www.globalshiplease.com/) (NYSE: GSL). I oversee various technical aspects involved in the operation and maintenance of bulk carrier vessels. My responsibilities encompass mechanical engineering, data analytics, budgeting, and commercial troubleshooting.
