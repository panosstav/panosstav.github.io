Hi, I'm Panagiotis. I am a graduate with a diploma (joint degree B.Sc. & M.Sc.) from [School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering](http://www.naval.ntua.gr/) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) (NTUA). My thesis title was "Operational Assessment of Marine Diesel Generators using Data", in which I deployed data analytics tools and regression analysis to model the fuel oil consumption of the generators.

Moreover, having been a former AI & Analytics Intern at [Latsco Marine Management Inc.](https://www.latsco.com/en), where I explored Artificial Intelligence applications in shipping, including route optimization with MILP, market segmentation with K-means, and price forecasting with Gradient Boosting.

I am currently working as a Junior Marine & AI Engineer at Technomar Shipping Inc., which is the manager of [Global Ship Lease Inc.](https://www.globalshiplease.com/) (NYSE: GSL). The responsibilities encompass mechanical engineering and predictive maintenance utilizing a fine-tuned transformer-based model for time series recognition. Moreover, I apply data analytics utilizing Apache Spark for analyzing sensor data to enhance the equipment’s reliability and ensure the fleet's engines’ smooth operation. Budgeting is also part of the role.
