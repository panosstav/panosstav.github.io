Hi, I'm Panagiotis. I am a graduate with a diploma (B.Sc. & M.Sc.) from [School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering](http://www.naval.ntua.gr/) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) (NTUA). My thesis title was: "Operational Assessment of Marine Diesel Generators using Data".

My passion for mathematics, technology, and financial markets is expressed by my current objective to delve into finance and try to solve complex engineering challenges. I possess strong interest in equity market and investments.

I am a former chartering intern in [Latsco Marine Management Inc.](https://www.latsco.com/en), where I initially worked in the financial markets and global trade.

I am currently working as a technical coordinator at Technomar Shipping Inc., which is the manager of [Global Ship Lease Inc.](https://www.globalshiplease.com/) (NYSE: GSL), where I oversee various technical aspects of the operation and maintenance of bulk carrier vessels, such as mechanical engineering, data analytics, budgeting and commercial troubleshooting.
